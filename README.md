# tdlib-telegram-bot-api-docker

## Purpose of the project

Produce working, minimal Docker image for the Telegram Bot API server together with easy
to use pipeline generating builds on the changes within the main repository managed by
Telegram team.

**Motivation:** [#0](https://medium.com/swlh/building-your-home-raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-14eeeb3c521e), [#1](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api/issues/65), [#2](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api/issues/65)

This project does not modify any part of the [tdlib/telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api) code.

## Issues

As I do not modify any part of the server code I am not responsible for the way it works. For that purpose you should open an issue on the [telegram bot api server](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api/issues) issue tracker.

**TL;DR:** My responsibility ends when container and binary starts.

## Build schedule
Build will be triggered automatically once a week to produce the latest version of the Telegram API Server.
I would set it for the daily release but every build takes ~2.5 hours and generates additional costs on my side.

Images are versioned in format `1.0.x` where `x` is a build number.
There's additional version tag added, for example `api-5.1` where `5.1` is the version of Telegram API supported by the image.

## How to use the image

Images created within this project support following architectures: AMD64 and ARM64

Yes, it means you can run them on regular servers and **Raspberry Pi 4** and above as well! ðŸ¥³

### Github authentication

~~You may need to authenticate with github ([see this thread](https://github.community/t/docker-pull-from-public-github-package-registry-fail-with-no-basic-auth-credentials-error/16358/87)) to pull even the publicly available images. To do so you need to create [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `read:packages` scope and use it to authenticate your docker client with the Github Docker Registry.~~

Update: After move to GHCR.io there's no need authenticate and you should be able to pull images without any additional magic.

### Docker configuration

```
docker pull ghcr.io/lukaszraczylo/tdlib-telegram-bot-api-docker/telegram-api-server:latest
docker run -p 8081:8081 -e TELEGRAM_API_ID=yourApiID -e TELEGRAM_API_HASH=yourApiHash -t ghcr.io/lukaszraczylo/tdlib-telegram-bot-api-docker/telegram-api-server
```

*Thing to remember:* Entrypoint is set to the server binary, therefore you can still modify parameters on the go, as shown below
